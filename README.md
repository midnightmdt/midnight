Midnight
=======================================

Midnight is a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake cryptocurrency that uses the Blue Midnight Wish hashing algorithm throughout, for block hashes as well as additional replacement of Bitcoin's double-SHA256 hashing.  Proof-of-work in Midnight is ongoing.  The initial mining emission is a high reward using a triangle waveform, with proof-of-stake high rewards interleaved.  After approximately 15 days of high reward period, the block reward for both POW and POS goes to 1 MDT per block, and halves every year to a floor of 0.125 MDT for POW and 0.25 MDT for POS.  Every 720 blocks is a 100 MDT coin reward, which acts as an incentive to mine on a continuous basis.
